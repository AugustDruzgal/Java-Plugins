# Java-Plugins

There is way too much code to efficiently upload my java plugins folders without compressing them, even after removing the less important ones, so I will later be even more selective of which plugins I upload. These plugins are all intended for Minecraft Spigot servers or Paper servers, and they demonstrate code that I believe to be somewhat competitive to that of high-end server development.
